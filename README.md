# RiseHigh_Fall2019
Relevant data, script and other material for the signal and image processing module developed for the Rise High Program.

## Rough outline of days [2](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%202) & [3](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%203)

### Need:
1. [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)
2. Relevant data
---------------------------------------------------------------

#### Day [2](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%202):
##### Intro to signal processing
1. [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) script for tutorial.
  * Learning outcome: Hands-on experience with OCTAVE (essentially MATLAB).
  * Learning outcome: Getting hands slightly dirty with signal processing fundamentals.
2. GUI (in Octave) for decoding audio message.
  * Learning outcome: Knowledge transfer from the tutorial.


---------------------------------------------------------------
#### Day [3](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%203):
##### Relevancy in biomedicine
1. Use EKG, EMG or EEG data of interest collected on [**Day 1**](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%201) (student-wise assignment indicated by random number assignment).
  * Learning outcome: Utilization of [**Day 2**](https://github.com/jasontsmith2718/RiseHigh_Fall2019/tree/master/Day%202) skills in biomedical application.
2. Image processing basics - extending from 1D to 2D
  * Learning outcome: Garnering fundamental knowledge in application of image processing and its importance in biomedicine.
  * Learning outcome: Obtain basic understanding as to how automation and computational methodology can help perform conventionally complicated & time-consuming tasks much faster and often times better than humans.
