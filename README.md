# RiseHigh_Fall2019
Relevant data, script and other material for the signal and image processing module developed for the Rise High Program.

### Rough outline of days 2 & 3

#### Day 2
##### Intro to signal processing
1. Octave script for tutorial.
  * Learning outcome: Hands-on experience with OCTAVE (essentially MATLAB).
  * Learning outcome: Getting hands slightly dirty with signal processing fundamentals.
2. GUI (in Octave) for decoding audio message.
  * Learning outcome: Knowledge transfer from the tutorial.
  
#### Day 3
##### Relevancy in biomedicine
1. Use EKG, EMG or EEG data of interest collected on **Day 1** (student-wise assignment indicated by random number assignment).
  * Learning outcome: Utilization of **Day 2** skills in biomedical application.
2. Image processing basics - extending from 1D to 2D
  * Learning outcome: Garnering fundamental knowledge in application of image processing and its importance in biomedicine.
  * Learning outcome: Obtain basic understanding as to how automation and computational methodology can help perform conventionally complicated & time-consuming tasks much faster and often times better than humans.
